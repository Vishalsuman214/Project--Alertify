# Vercel Deployment Fixes - FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED Resolution

## Issues Fixed:
- [x] Removed BackgroundScheduler (incompatible with serverless)
- [x] Updated Flask app configuration for Vercel
- [x] Fixed template folder path for backend structure
- [x] Updated SECRET_KEY to use environment variables
- [x] Modified CSV file paths to use /tmp directory
- [x] Removed duplicate update_user_email_credentials function

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. app.py Updates:
- Removed APScheduler BackgroundScheduler
- Added template_folder='../templates' to Flask app config
- Changed SECRET_KEY to use os.environ.get()
- Created app instance for Vercel deployment

### 2. csv_handler.py Updates:
- Changed file paths to use /tmp directory for Vercel
- Removed duplicate update_user_email_credentials function

### 3. Deployment Configuration:
- vercel.json properly configured for Python runtime
- requirements.txt in root directory

## Next Steps:
- Deploy to Vercel and test
- Set SECRET_KEY environment variable in Vercel dashboard
- Monitor for any remaining issues

## Notes:
- Email reminders will need external cron job service (not BackgroundScheduler)
- CSV files now stored in /tmp (ephemeral storage)
- App structure optimized for serverless deployment
